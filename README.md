## Description

Welcome to RoboTF's AI Suite of tools for running Large Language Models (LLM's) locally or self-hosted. This will be a collection of Docker Compose and other such resources for helping people get start running such tools as LocalAI, ComfyUI, Open WebUI, n8ns, Chromadb, postgres, Unstructured API, and more for full stack of AI/LLM related tools.

Check out the Youtube series for Build an Ubuntu AI/LLM Server from scratch here: [https://www.youtube.com/@RoboTFAI](https://www.youtube.com/@RoboTFAI)

### Ubuntu Server 24.04 Bootstrap Guide

See the guide on setting up a fresh Ubuntu server 24.04 with all Nvidia drivers, cuda, toolkit, etc, etc at [Bootstrap Guide](/Ubuntu-bootstrap/Bootstrap.md)

Once you have your server up with all dependencies move on to the LocalAI with Docker Compose below.

### LocalAI with Docker Compose

Edit the `LocalAI/localai-compose.yaml` to your liking and match the volume mount, and environment variables you want to use. See the docs at [localai](https://localai.io)

Set Up Docker Compose: Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed, then run:

```bash
make localai-up
```

To stop it

```bash
make localai-down
```

**Warning LocalAI will download several models on it's first startup to handle Chat, Image Generation, etc, etc as this calls the AIO image. See more info at [localai](https://localai.io)

Visit `http://<your server ip>:8080` to see the LocalAI UI

### ComfyUI with Docker Compose

Edit the `ComfyUI/comfyui-compose.yaml` to your liking and match the volume mount, and environment variables you want to use. See the docs at [comfyui](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) and [YanWenKun](https://github.com/YanWenKun/ComfyUI-Docker) for docs on the container.

Set Up Docker Compose: Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed, then run:

```bash
make comfyui-up
```

To stop it

```bash
make comfyui-down
```

**Warning ComfyUI will download several models on it's first startup to support Image Generation See more info at [YanWenKun](https://github.com/YanWenKun/ComfyUI-Docker)

Visit `http://<your server ip>:8188` to see the ComfyUI Application

```bash
make help
```

Visit http://<your server ip>:8188 to see the ComfyUI UI

### Open WebUI with Docker Compose

Edit the `Open-WebUI/openwebui-compose.yaml` to your liking and match the volume mount, and environment variables you want to use. See the docs at [openwebui](https://github.com/open-webui)

```bash
make openwebui-down
```

Visit `http://<your server ip>:3000` to see the Open WebUI

### Flowise with Docker Compose

Edit the `Flowise/flowise-compose.yaml` to your liking and match the volume mount, and environment variables you want to use. See the docs at [Flowise](https://github.com/FlowiseAI/Flowise)

Flowise requires a local postgres instance for this run, therefore there is Postgres Docker-compose stack that will start-up first, along with LocalAI before Flowise starts.

Set Up Docker Compose: Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed, then run:

```bash
make flowise-up
```

To stop it

```bash
make flowise-down
```

Visit http://<your server ip>:3001 to see the Flowise UI

### n8n with Docker Compose

Edit the `n8n/n8n-compose.yaml` to your liking and match the volume mount, and environment variables you want to use.

Set Up Docker Compose: Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed, then run:

```bash
make n8n-up
```

To stop it

```bash
make n8n-down

Set Up Docker Compose: Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed, then run:

```bash
make chroma-up
```

To stop it

```bash
make chroma-down
```
ChromaDB available on `<your-server-ip>:8000`

### Untructured API with Docker Compose

Edit the `Unstructured-API/unstructuredapi-compose.yaml` to your liking and match the volume mount, and environment variables you want to use.

Set Up Docker Compose: Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed, then run:

```bash
make unstructured-up
```

To stop it

```bash
make unstructured-down
```

Unstructured API available on `<your-server-ip>:8003`

### RoboTF LLM Tools with Docker Compose

Edit the `RoboTF-LLM-Tools/robotf-llm-tools-compose.yaml` to your liking and match the volume mount, and environment variables you want to use.

## Acknowledgments üèÜ

Shoutout to LocalAI for powering my Local LLM's [localai](https://localai.io)

Thanks to [openwebui](https://github.com/open-webui) for providing a great AI/LLM chat interface

[flowise](https://github.com/FlowiseAI/Flowise) is a great project for building AI/LLM workflows and agents!

We love [comfyui](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) and [YanWenKun](https://github.com/YanWenKun/ComfyUI-Docker) for maintaining the docker images.

[n8n](https://docs.n8n.io/) is fun and awesome to work with

[chroma](https://docs.trychroma.com/docs/overview/introduction) is a fast and easy to use AI application database for embedding, vector, and much more!

[unstructured-api](https://docs.unstructured.io/welcome) is great at ingesting and processing unstructured documents for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

Shoutout to [j4ys0n](https://github.com/j4ys0n/local-ai-stack) Who gave some original inspiration for this. See his repo in link.
